Why is Javascript relevant/why have this FFT
==============================================
Reach
------
 - Browsers
		- The rise of the Web
 - Mobile
 - Its going beyond the browser - server, mobile apps...
 - So you cannot hide from it and if you have to do it then you should do it well and take advantage of the modern technologies
 - Also in Spartan our use of JavaScript has risen massively in the past year.
	- I remember a when I joined Spartan I would go to Alt.Net meetings and they would talk excitedly about jQuery and I woudln't get what it is for. We did NO JavaScript, now our Portal is full of it (and there is lots more to come!)
